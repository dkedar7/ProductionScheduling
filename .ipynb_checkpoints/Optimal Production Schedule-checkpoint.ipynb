    "&emsp;&emsp;Manufacturing any product or service involves collaboration between many independent manufacturing sites. Usually, the total material outcome of the network is merely the sum of the outcomes from these individual sites, and any disturbance in production propagates both downstream and upstream. On the other hand, the net flow of material is always downstream and the net flow of information is always upstream (Figure 1). Even if all of these sites operate under a single organization, they are fiscally and operationally independent. Therefore, comparing results obtained by scheduling using one, a global optimization strategy and two, a site-by-site local optimization gives valuable insights about the disturbance propagation.\n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;In this study, we study a model that can be used to optimize an organizationâ€™s manufacturing processes through a lot sizing and scheduling problem (LSSP) in a multi-site manufacturing system. The proposed model is applied to a case study involving a multi-site manufacturing system of braking equipment for the automotive industry. A schedule for this process, assuming an integrated approach (global strategy) as well as one assuming a site-by-site approach, is created. This optimization problem includes multi-product demand and cost constraints (fixed and inventory costs). The LSSP is then formulated into a mixed integer problem and the optimization problem is solved in GAMS using a CPLEX (MILP) solver. Through this model, we demonstrate that optimizing a schedule considering a global optimization, encompassing all sites in a manufacturing process, results in a lower total cost than optimizing each site individually on a local level.\n",

    "        This is probably the most common scheduling strategy used in industrial optimization. In this, the operation of each manufacturing unit is optimized as an isolated unit. The basic assumption is that the schedule of processes which make up a unit are independent of the processes from other units, except for the deadline. The deadline, on the contrary, is the only entity which contributes to the schedule of a unit and does not belong to any process inside the unit. For example, when studying any site N, the only factors which are taken into consideration are the deadline-governed deliverables of site N to the next site and if applicable, the its deliverables to the end-users. The deadlines and needs of other sites are not considered. Such a strategy is called the Local Optimization Strategy (LOS) (Figure 3). In simpler words, there are N objective functions in LOS, one belonging to each of the N sites.\n",

Site 3 optimizes its own operations and passes back its demands to site 2. Site 2 optimizes its operations depending on the deadline and requirements given by site 3 and passes back its demands to site 1. It is also important to note that the inventory cost for storing feed materials is almost three times of that for storing the final products at every site. If given a finite amount of feed material on any day, a site would prefer to store it only after processing it into products. To account for this, the inventory cost due to the added feed material inventory is not included in the objective function for the site at which it is being processed. The Gantt chart using the LOS strategy for all three sites (Figure 6) shows how all scheduling strategies minimize cost by reducing inventory and pushing production as close to the delivery deadline as possible."

It was found that the monthly GOS approach is the cheapest of all approaches, followed by yearly GOS, followed by LOS. Additionally, figure 9 shows that the component governing this decrease in total cost is the inventory cost.
