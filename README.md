# ProductionScheduling

Optimal production schedule of a multi-site manufacturing facility.

## Objective
The objective is to minimize the total cost of the production process by creating an optimal production schedule. The constraints in this process arise out of the bottlenecks created in each of these sites. Gopalakrishnan et al. (1995) discuss the solution strategy that is needed to tackle such a problem. All required data is obtained from Gnoni et al. (2003).


## Available Data
The following data is available (Gnoni et al., 2003): 
1. Per day inventory cost for each of the nine products and process intermediates. 
2. Demand of each end-user product at the end of one year. 
3. Fixed cost asoociated with the production of each of the nine products and process intermediates. 
4. Time required for production of each product. 
5. Total time of the day for which processes run.
